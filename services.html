                    <p class="card-text">The current CR voting system used in our college is based on paper ballots, manual counting, and a centralized counting process, which leaves room for errors and slow results. The aim of this project is to develop a secure, reliable, and efficient online voting system that would modernize the voting process, increase accessibility and reduce the potential for errors.
